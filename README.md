This is a project I worked on as part of a React tutorial I recently completed where the goal was to code the various sections and components that make up the user interface. By using React, framer-motion, and Tailwind CSS, I gained a better understanding of how to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces. While working on the project, I faced some challenges with framer-motion, but with some extra effort  I was able to to resolve the problems and deliver the final product.
